Mediapadtech - Guest eXPerience

This application is an open source Hotel in room guest experience enhancer.
It enables hotel managers to provide guest services directly on theirs phone and tablets.
From a guest point of view, it will enable a whole new stay experience.

Fist based on Java, we decided to make it open source and migrate it to scala.
The application will be gradually open sourced while moving to scala.

We will also provide an "on demand" service so you can quickly evaluate the possibilities.
